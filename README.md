# nautobot-golden-config

A plugin for [Nautobot](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot) that intends to provide context around golden configuration.

**This version is currently in Beta and will require a rebuild of the database for a 1.0 release.**


# Introduction

## What is the Golden Configuration Plugin?

The golden configuration plugin is a Nautobot plugin that aims to solve common configuration management challenges.

## Key Use Cases

This plugin enable four (4) key use cases.


1. **Configuration Backups** - Is a Nornir process to connect to devices, optionally parse out lines/secrets, backup the configuration, and save to a Git repository.
2. **Intended Configuration** - Is a Nornir process to generate configuration based on a Git repo of Jinja files to combine with a GraphQL generated data and a Git repo to store the intended configuration.
3. **Source of Truth Aggregation** - Is a GraphQL query per device that creates a data structure used in the generation of configuration.
4. **Configuration Compliance** - Is a Nornir process to run comparison of the actual (via backups) and intended (via Jinja file creation) CLI configurations.

>Notice: The operator's of their own Nautobot instance are welcome to use any combination of these features. Though the appearance may seem like they are tightly 
coupled, this isn't actually the case. For example, one can obtain backup configurations from their current RANCID/Oxidized process and simply provide a Git Repo
of the location of the backup configurations, and the compliance process would work the same way. Also, another user may only want to generate configurations,
but not want to use other features, which is perfectly fine to do so.

## Screenshots

There are many features and capabilities the plugin provides into the Nautobot ecosystem. The following screenshots are intended to provide a quick visual overview of some of these features.

The golden configuration is driven by jobs that run a series of tasks and the result is captured in this overview.

# Contributing

Pull requests are welcomed and automatically built and tested against multiple versions of Python and Nautobot through TravisCI.

The project is packaged with a light development environment based on `docker-compose` to help with the local development of the project and to run tests within TravisCI.

The project is following Network to Code software development guidelines and are leveraging the following:
- Black, Pylint, Bandit, flake8, and pydocstyle for Python linting and formatting.
- Django unit test to ensure the plugin is working properly.

## CLI Helper Commands

The project features a CLI helper based on [invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) to help setup the development environment. The commands are listed below in 3 categories:
- `dev environment`
- `utility`
- `testing`. 

Each command can be executed with `invoke <command>`. All commands support the arguments `--nautobot-ver` and `--python-ver` if you want to manually define the version of Python and Nautobot to use. Each command also has its own help `invoke <command> --help`

> Note: to run the mysql (mariadb) development environment, set the environment variable as such `export NAUTOBOT_USE_MYSQL=1`.

### Local Development Environment

```
  build            Build all docker images.
  debug            Start Nautobot and its dependencies in debug mode.
  destroy          Destroy all containers and volumes.
  restart          Restart Nautobot and its dependencies in detached mode.
  start            Start Nautobot and its dependencies in detached mode.
  stop             Stop Nautobot and its dependencies.
```

### Utility 

```
  cli              Launch a bash shell inside the running Nautobot container.
  create-user      Create a new user in django (default: admin), will prompt for password.

  nbshell          Launch a nbshell session.
```

### Testing 

```
  bandit           Run bandit to validate basic static code security analysis.
  black            Run black to check that Python files adhere to its style standards.
