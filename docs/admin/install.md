### Access Requirements

!!! warning "Developer Note - Remove Me!"
    What external systems (if any) it needs access to in order to work.

## Install Guide

!!! note
    Plugins can be installed manually or using Python's `pip`. See the [nautobot documentation](https://nautobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/#install-the-package) for more details. The pip package name for this plugin is [`nautobot-golden-config`](https://pypi.org/project/nautobot-golden-config/).

The plugin is available as a Python package via PyPI and can be installed with `pip`:

```shell
pip install nautobot-golden-config
```

To ensure Golden Config is automatically re-installed during future upgrades, create a file named `local_requirements.txt` (if not already existing) in the Nautobot root directory (alongside `requirements.txt`) and list the `nautobot-golden-config` package:

```shell
echo nautobot-golden-config >> local_requirements.txt
```

Once installed, the plugin needs to be enabled in your Nautobot configuration. The following block of code below shows the additional configuration required to be added to your `nautobot_config.py` file:

- Append `"nautobot_golden_config"` to the `PLUGINS` list.
- Append the `"nautobot_golden_config"` dictionary to the `PLUGINS_CONFIG` dictionary and override any defaults.

```python
# In your nautobot_config.py
PLUGINS = ["nautobot_golden_config"]

# PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
#   "nautobot_golden_config": {
#     ADD YOUR SETTINGS HERE
#   }
# }
```

Once the Nautobot configuration is updated, run the Post Upgrade command (`nautobot-server post_upgrade`) to run migrations and clear any cache:

```shell
nautobot-server post_upgrade
```

Then restart (if necessary) the Nautobot services which may include:

- Nautobot
- Nautobot Workers
- Nautobot Scheduler

```shell
sudo systemctl restart nautobot nautobot-worker nautobot-scheduler
```
