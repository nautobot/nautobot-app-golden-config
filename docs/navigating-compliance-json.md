# Navigating Compliance Using Structured Data

> Warning:
This feature is in early development and is only implemented within the API.  There are multiple caveats that need to be considered and are listed below.

## Caveats
- Must have a `Platform` created specifically for the feature.
- Both the compliance `feature` and `rule` need to be unique for the JSON `config-type`.
- When creating `Compliance Rules` with the config type of JSON, the `config to match` field is not used but must have bogus data in order to save to the DB.
- Does **NOT** require Git repositories and for backup and intended.
- Mixing/Matching CLI and JSON compliance rules is **NOT** supported.  A device should only have compliance rules from one or the other.

## Quick Start Guide

1. To get started with the structured data(JSON) compliance check the first step is to create a platform.

2. Next, the compliance feature needs to be created.

3. Link the feature that was just created to a rule definition.

> Notice: Bogus text data `none` was added to `Config to Match` which is not used in the current implementation.

4. Now that the definitions are created and the rule is mapped to the platform we created the API execution can be performed.

Here is an example of a `POST` to the `/plugins​/golden-config​/config-compliance​/` endpoint.

```json
{
  "actual": "{\"aaa\": {\"servers\": [\"1.1.1.1\"]}}",
  "intended": "{\"aaa\": {\"servers\": [\"1.1.1.1\"]}}",
  "device": "472c3786-4499-4e34-8d8e-291c4c7f32a9",
  "rule": "87cc003b-9025-472d-bf3c-e5b62bf91987"
}
```

> Notice: The UUID is needed for the device and rule to execute against.  This data can be found in the UI or by querying the proper endpoints, `/plugins/golden-config/compliance-rule/` and `/dcim​/devices​/`.

Once the API call is made the response data provides a quick snapshot.
```json
{
  "id": "be35a701-0cb0-418a-98e7-a82d99db857e",
  "device": "472c3786-4499-4e34-8d8e-291c4c7f32a9",
  "rule": "87cc003b-9025-472d-bf3c-e5b62bf91987",
  "actual": "{\"aaa\": {\"servers\": [\"1.1.1.1\"]}}",
  "intended": "{\"aaa\": {\"servers\": [\"1.1.1.1\"]}}",
  "ordered": true,
  "compliance": true,
  "display": "nautobot-iosv-1 -> iosv-json - aaa-json -> True"
}
```

You can also see the compliance data in the UI once it is created via API.

In the navigation menu: `Plugins -> Configuration Compliance`.

Example of a Non-Compliant rule:

> Note:
All subsequent updates to the compliance rule need to use the `PUT` or `PATCH` API methods and they need to provide the UUID that was created for the specific compliance execution. This UUID is generated by (unique_together = ("device", "rule"))

As soon as a Configuration Compliance object has been created using the API seen above, the `Configuration Overview` will be available, and will show the **diff** action button.

![Example of Diff Icon](./img/06-navigating-compliance-json.png)

This will **only** show up for devices using JSON compliance rules.

> Note: In the backend processing the plugin is finding all compliance rule objects that exist for the device and is creating the backup and intended configurations on the fly.  This all occurs when the **diff** action button is clicked.  When the modal is closed the Overview page is refreshed and the backup and intended configurations icons are now available.

![Example of Diff](./img/07-navigating-compliance-json.png)

If the page is refreshed the Status and other icons will now appear.

![Show Updated Overview](./img/08-navigating-compliance-json.png)

The detailed diff view will show a side by side diff, this looks the same as the CLI view.
