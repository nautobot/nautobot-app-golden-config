# Golden Configuration 

An navigation overview of the entire plugin.

# Home

The Home view is a portal to understand what the status of the devices are. 

![Home Overview](./img/golden-overview.png)

Some of the information descibed in this view, may not be immediately obvious.

* The Backup/Intended/Compliance status will always show the last time the job was successfully ran for that device, but there are several conditions it may be in.
  * Green with a date indicates that the ran was successful, which was the last time the job ran. 
  * Red with a data indicates the last time the job ran successfully, with the last time the job was attempted in be shown when you mouse over the date.
  * A red double-dashed icon indicated the job has never been successful
* The icons are provided in the following order, that largely matches the status.
  * Backups
  * Intended
  * Unix Diff
  * SoT aggregation data
  * Run job

The first four bring up a "modal" or "dialogue box" which has a detailed view for a dedicated page. The run job brings the user to a job to run all three 
componets against all of the devices.

# Jobs

There are a series of Jobs that are registed via the Plugin. They can be viewed from the standard Jobs view.

![Job Overview](./img/job-overview.png)

Each Job attempts to provide sane error handling, and respects the `debug` flag to provide more information.

# Git Settings

The plugin makes heavy use of the nautobot git data sources feature. There are up to three repositories used in the application. This set of instructions will walk an operator throush setting up the backup repository. The steps are the same, except for the "Provides" field name chosen.

In order to setup this repository, go to Nautobot and navigate to the Data Sources Git integration. `Extensibility -> Git Repositories`.

# Plugins Buttons

The plugins buttons provides you the ability to navigate to Run the script, overview report, and detailed report.

# Run Script

This can be accessed via the Plugins drop-down via `Run Script` button of the `Home` view, the user will be provided a form of the Job (as described 
above), which will allow the user to limit the scope of the request.

# Device Template Content

The plugin makes use of template content `right_page` in order to use display in-line the status of that device in the traditional Nautobot view. From here you can click the link to see the detail compliance view.

# Site Template Content

The plugin makes use of template content `right_page` in order to use display in-line the status of that entire site in the traditional Nautobot view. 

# API

There is no way to currently run the script via an API, this would be helpful to use in the configuration compliance workflow, and will be a future feature.

# Feature Enablement

Enabling features such as backup or compliance, will render those parts of the UI visible. It is worth noting that disabling features does not provide any
garbage collection and it is up to the operator to remove such data.
