# Decide On Development Environment

## Introduction

The cookie provides the ability to develop and manage the Nautobot server locally (with supporting services being *Dockerized*) or using only Docker containers to manage Nautobot. The main difference between the two environments is the ability to debug and use **pdb** when developing locally. Debugging with **pdb** within the Docker container is more complicated, but can still be accomplished by either exec'ing into the container or attaching your IDE to the container and running the Nautobot service manually within the container.

The upside to having the Nautobot service handled by Docker rather than locally is that you do not have to manage the Nautobot server and the [Docker logs](#docker-logs) provide the majority information you will need to help troubleshoot while getting started quickly and not requiring you to perform several manual steps to get started and remember to have the Nautobot server running or having it run in a separate terminal while you develop. Ultimately, the decision is yours as to how you want to develop, but it was agreed it would be a good idea to provide pros and cons for each development environment.

!!! note
	The local environment still uses Docker containers for the supporting services (Postgres, Redis, and RQ Worker), but the Nautobot server is handled locally by you, the developer.

Follow the directions below for the specific development environment that you choose.

## Poetry

Poetry is used in lieu of the "virtualenv" commands and is used for either environment. The virtual environment will provide most of the Python packages required to manage the development environment such as **Invoke**, but see the [Local Development Environment](#local-development-environment) section to see how to install Nautobot if you're going to be developing locally. To get started, run the following commands:

```bash
➜ poetry install
➜ poetry shell
```

The first command creates the virtual environment through Poetry and installs all relevant dependencies, as outlined in the `pyproject.toml` file.

The second command puts your shell session into the virtual environment, so all commands ran going forward are from within the virtual environment. (This is similar to running the `source venv/bin/activate` command with virtualenvs).

## Full Docker Development Environment

### Invoke

The beauty of **Invoke** is that the Cookiecutter template provides several simple CLI commands to get developing fast. You'll use a few `invoke` commands to get your environment up and running.

#### Invoke - Building the Docker Image

The first thing you need to do is build the necessary Docker image for Nautobot that installs the specific **nautobot_ver**. The image is used for Nautobot and the RQ worker service used by Docker Compose.

```bash
➜ invoke build
... <omitted for brevity>
#14 exporting to image
#14 sha256:e8c613e07b0b7ff33893b694f7759a10d42e180f2b4dc349fb57dc6b71dcab00
#14 exporting layers
#14 exporting layers 1.2s done
#14 writing image sha256:2d524bc1665327faa0d34001b0a9d2ccf450612bf8feeb969312e96a2d3e3503 done
#14 naming to docker.io/nautobot-golden-config/nautobot:latest-py3.7 done
```

### Invoke - Starting the Development Environment

Next, you need to start up your Docker containers.

```bash
➜ invoke start
Starting Nautobot in detached mode...
Running docker-compose command "up --detach"
Creating network "nautobot_golden_config_default" with the default driver
Creating volume "nautobot_golden_config_postgres_data" with default driver
Creating nautobot_golden_config_redis_1 ...
Creating nautobot_golden_config_docs_1  ...
Creating nautobot_golden_config_postgres_1 ...
Creating nautobot_golden_config_postgres_1 ... done
Creating nautobot_golden_config_redis_1    ... done
Creating nautobot_golden_config_nautobot_1 ...
Creating nautobot_golden_config_docs_1     ... done
Creating nautobot_golden_config_nautobot_1 ... done
Creating nautobot_golden_config_worker_1   ...
Creating nautobot_golden_config_worker_1   ... done
Docker Compose is now in the Docker CLI, try `docker compose up`
```

This will start all of the Docker containers used for hosting Nautobot. Once the containers are up, you should be able to open up a web browser, and view the homepage at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

!!! note
	Sometimes the containers take a minute to fully spin up. If the page doesn't load right away, wait a minute and try again.

```bash
➜ docker ps
****CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                            COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                       NAMES

```

You should see the following containers running after running `invoke start` at this time of writing.

### Invoke - Creating a Superuser

The Nautobot development image will automatically provision a super user when specifying the following variables within `creds.env` which is the default when copying `creds.example.env` to `creds.env`.

- **NAUTOBOT_CREATE_SUPERUSER=true**
- **NAUTOBOT_SUPERUSER_API_TOKEN=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567**
- **NAUTOBOT_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=admin**

!!! note
	The default username is **admin**, but can be overridden by specifying **NAUTOBOT_SUPERUSER_USERNAME**.

If you need to create additional superusers, run the follow commands.

```bash
➜ invoke createsuperuser
Running docker-compose command "ps --services --filter status=running"
Running docker-compose command "exec nautobot nautobot-server createsuperuser --username admin"
Error: That username is already taken.
Username: ntc
Email address: ntc@networktocode.com
Password:
Password (again):
Superuser created successfully.
```

### Invoke - Stopping the Development Environment

The last command to know for now is `invoke stop`.

```bash
➜ invoke stop
Stopping Nautobot...
Running docker-compose command "down"
Stopping nautobot_golden_config_worker_1   ...
Stopping nautobot_golden_config_nautobot_1 ...
Stopping nautobot_golden_config_docs_1     ...

Stopping nautobot_golden_config_nautobot_1 ... done
Stopping nautobot_golden_config_postgres_1 ... done
Stopping nautobot_golden_config_redis_1    ... done
Stopping nautobot_golden_config_docs_1     ... done
Removing nautobot_golden_config_worker_1   ...
Removing nautobot_golden_config_nautobot_1 ...
Removing nautobot_golden_config_docs_1     ...
Removing nautobot_golden_config_redis_1    ...

Removing nautobot_golden_config_postgres_1 ... done
Removing nautobot_golden_config_docs_1     ... done
Removing nautobot_golden_config_worker_1   ... done
Removing nautobot_golden_config_redis_1    ... done
Removing nautobot_golden_config_nautobot_1 ... done
Removing network nautobot_golden_config_default
```

This will safely shut down all of your running Docker containers for this project. When you are ready to spin containers back up, it is as simple as running `invoke start` again like in [**Invoke - Starting the Development Environment**](#invoke---starting-the-development-environment).

!!! note
	If you're wanting to reset the database and configuration settings, you can use the `invoke destroy` command, but it will result in data loss so make sure that is what you want to do.

### Real-Time Updates? How Cool!

Your environment should now be fully setup, all necessary Docker containers are created and running, and you're logged into Nautobot in your web browser. Now what?

Now you can start developing your plugin in the folder generated for you by Cookiecutter.

## Docker Magic

The magic here is the root directory is mounted inside your Docker containers when built and ran, so **any** changes made to the files in here are directly updated to the Nautobot plugin code running in Docker. This means that as you modify the code in your `nautobot-plugin` folder (or whatever you named your plugin when generating it via Cookiecutter), the changes will be instantly updated in Nautobot.

!!! note
	There are a few exceptions to this, as outlined in the section [To Rebuild or Not To Rebuild](#to-rebuild-or-not-to-rebuild).

The backend Django process is setup to automatically reload itself (it only takes a couple of seconds) every time a file is updated (saved). So for example, if you were to update one of the files like `tables.py`, then save it, the changes will be visible right away in the web browser!

!!! note
	You may get connection refused while Django reloads, but it should be refreshed fairly quickly.

### Docker Logs

When trying to debug an issue, one helpful thing you can look at are the logs within the Docker containers.

```bash
➜ docker logs <name of container> -f
```

!!! note
	The `-f` tag will keep the logs open, and output them in realtime as they are generated.

So for example, our plugin is named `nautobot-golden-config`, the command would most likely be `docker logs nautobot_golden_config_nautobot_1 -f`. You can find the name of all running containers via `docker ps`.

If you want to view the logs specific to the worker container, simply use the name of that container instead.

## To Rebuild or Not to Rebuild

Most of the time, you will not need to rebuild your images. Simply running `invoke start` and `invoke stop` is enough to keep your environment going.

However there are a couple of instances when you will want to.

### Updating Environment Variables

To add environment variables to your containers, thus allowing Nautobot to use them, you will update/add them in the `development/dev.env` file. However, doing so is considered updating the underlying container shell, instead of Django (which auto restarts itself on changes).

To get new environment variables to take effect, you will need stop any running images, rebuild the images, then restart them. This can easily be done with 3 commands:

```bash
➜ invoke stop
➜ invoke build
➜ invoke start
```

Once completed, the new/updated environment variables should now be live.

### Installing Additional Python Packages

If you want your plugin to leverage another available Nautobot plugin or another Python package, you can easily add them into your Docker environment.

```bash
➜ poetry shell
➜ poetry add netutils
```

Once the dependencies are resolved, stop the existing containers, rebuild the Docker image, and then start all containers again.

```bash
➜ invoke stop
➜ invoke build
➜ invoke start
```

### Installing Additional Nautobot Plugins

Let's say for example you want the new plugin you're creating to integrate into Slack. To do this, you will want to integrate into the existing Nautobot ChatOps Plugin.

```bash
➜ poetry shell
➜ poetry add nautobot-chatops-plugin
```

Once you activate the virtual environment via Poetry, you then tell Poetry to install the new plugin.

Before you continue, you'll need to update the file `development/nautobot_config.py` accordingly with the name of the new plugin under `PLUGINS` and any relevant settings as necessary for the plugin under `PLUGINS_CONFIG`. Since you're modifying the underlying OS (not just Django files), you need to rebuild the image. This is a similar process to updating environment variables, which was explained earlier.

```bash
➜ invoke stop
➜ invoke build
➜ invoke start
```

Once the containers are up and running, you should now see the new plugin installed in your Nautobot instance.

You can even launch an `ngrok` service locally on your laptop, pointing to port 8080 (such as for chatops development), and it will point traffic directly to your Docker images. How cool!

### Updating Python Version

To update the Python version, you can update it within `tasks.py`.

```python
namespace = Collection("nautobot_golden_config")
namespace.configure(
    {
        "nautobot_golden_config": {
            ...
            "python_ver": "3.7",
	    ...
        }
    }
)
```

Or set the `INVOKE_NAUTOBOT_GOLDEN_CONFIG_PYTHON_VER` variable

### Updating Nautobot Version

To update the Python version, you can update it within `tasks.py`.

```python
namespace = Collection("nautobot_golden_config")
namespace.configure(
    {
        "nautobot_golden_config": {
            ...
            "nautobot_ver": "1.0.2",
	    ...
        }
    }
)
```

Or set the `INVOKE_NAUTOBOT_GOLDEN_CONFIG_NAUTOBOT_VER` variable

## Local Development Environment

Refer back to the [Contributing](./dev_contributing.md) guide for developing locally.

## Other Miscellaneous Commands To Know

### Python Shell

To drop into a Django shell for Nautobot (in the Docker container) run:

```bash
➜ invoke nbshell
```

This is the same as running:

```bash
➜ invoke cli
➜ nautobot-server nbshell
```

### iPython Shell Plus

Django also has a more advanced shell that uses iPython and that will automatically import all the models:

```bash
➜ invoke shell-plus
```

This is the same as running:

```bash
➜ invoke cli
➜ nautobot-server shell_plus
```

### Tests

To run tests against your code, you can run all of the tests that TravisCI runs against any new PR with:

```bash
➜ invoke tests
```

To run an individual test, you can run any or all of the following:

```bash
➜ invoke unittest
➜ invoke bandit
➜ invoke black
➜ invoke flake8
➜ invoke pydocstyle
➜ invoke pylint
```
