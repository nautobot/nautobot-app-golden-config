# Installing the App in Nautobot

Here you will find detailed instructions on how to **install** and **configure** the App within your Nautobot environment.

## Prerequisites

- The app relies on [`nautobot_plugin_nornir`](https://pypi.org/project/nautobot-plugin-nornir/) to be installed and both apps to be enabled in your configuration settings.
- The latest version of this app is compatible with Nautobot 2.0.0 and higher, see [this dedicated page](compatibility_matrix.md) for a full compatibility matrix and the deprecation policy.
- Databases supported: PostgreSQL, MySQL

### Access Requirements

There are no access requirements from external systems to this app.

## Install Guide

!!! note
    Apps can be installed from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) or locally. See the [Nautobot documentation](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/user-guide/administration/installation/app-install/) for more details. The pip package name for this app is [`nautobot-golden-config`](https://pypi.org/project/nautobot-golden-config/).

The app is available as a Python package via PyPI and can be installed with `pip`:

```shell
pip install nautobot-golden-config
```

To ensure Nautobot Golden Config is automatically re-installed during future upgrades, create a file named `local_requirements.txt` (if not already existing) in the Nautobot root directory (alongside `requirements.txt`) and list the `nautobot-golden-config` package:

```shell
echo nautobot-golden-config >> local_requirements.txt
```

Once installed, the app needs to be enabled in your Nautobot configuration. The following block of code below shows the additional configuration required to be added to your `nautobot_config.py` file:

- Append `"nautobot_golden_config"` to the `PLUGINS` list, and `"nautobot_plugin_nornir"` if it was not already there (more info [here](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/plugin-nornir/en/latest/)).
- Append the `"nautobot_golden_config"` dictionary to the `PLUGINS_CONFIG` dictionary, and `"nautobot_plugin_nornir"` if it was not already there.

```python
PLUGINS = ["nautobot_plugin_nornir", "nautobot_golden_config"]

PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "nautobot_plugin_nornir": {
        "nornir_settings": {
            "credentials": "nautobot_plugin_nornir.plugins.credentials.env_vars.CredentialsEnvVars",
            "runner": {
                "plugin": "threaded",
                "options": {
                    "num_workers": 20,
                },
            },
        },
    },
    "nautobot_golden_config": {
        "per_feature_bar_width": 0.15,
        "per_feature_width": 13,
        "per_feature_height": 4,
        "enable_backup": True,
        "enable_compliance": True,
        "enable_intended": True,
        "enable_sotagg": True,
        "enable_plan": True,
        "enable_deploy": True,
        "enable_postprocessing": False,
        "sot_agg_transposer": None,
        "postprocessing_callables": [],
        "postprocessing_subscribed": [],
        "jinja_env": {
            "undefined": "jinja2.StrictUndefined",
            "trim_blocks": True,
            "lstrip_blocks": False,
        },
        # "default_deploy_status": "Not Approved",
        # "get_custom_compliance": "my.custom_compliance.func"
    },
}
```

Once the Nautobot configuration is updated, run the Post Upgrade command (`nautobot-server post_upgrade`) to run migrations and clear any cache:

```shell
nautobot-server post_upgrade
```

Then restart (if necessary) the Nautobot services which may include:

- Nautobot
- Nautobot Workers
- Nautobot Scheduler

```shell
sudo systemctl restart nautobot nautobot-worker nautobot-scheduler
```

## App Configuration

The app behavior can be controlled with the following list of settings:

!!! note
    The `enable_backup`, `enable_compliance`, `enable_intended`, `enable_sotagg`, `enable_plan`, `enable_deploy`, and `enable_postprocessing` will toggle inclusion of the entire component.

| jinja_env | {"lstrip_blocks": False} | See Note Below | A dictionary of Jinja2 Environment options compatible with Jinja2.SandboxEnvironment() |

!!! note
    `platform_slug_map` configuration was removed as of the `v2.0.0` release of Golden Config, for more information please review the [v2 Migration Guide](./migrating_to_v2.md)

!!! note
    Over time the compliance report will become more dynamic, but for now allow users to configure the `per_*` configs in a way that fits best for them.

!!! note
    Defaults for Jinja2 environment settings (`jinja_env`) are as follows:

    ```python
        jinja_env = {
            "undefined": "jinja2.StrictUndefined",
            "trim_blocks": True,
            "lstrip_blocks": False,
        }
    ```

## Custom Dispatcher

Please note, that this should only be used in rare circumstances not covered in the previous constance settings, when you are truly "rolling your own" dispatcher. Previously, the `dispatcher_mapping` covered use cases that are now more easily handled. The only two use cases that should be required are.

- Provide support for network drivers not currently supported.
- Provide some custom business logic you need.

That being said, if you do fall into one of those use cases, you can set the dispatcher as followed:

```python
PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "nautobot_plugin_nornir": {
    },
    "nautobot_golden_config": {
        "custom_dispatcher": {
            "arista_eos": "my_custom.dispatcher.NornirDriver",
            "arbitrary_platform_name": "my_custom.dispatcher.OtherNornirDriver",
        },

    },
}
```

The format for defining these methods is via the dotted string format that will be imported by Django. For example, the Netmiko Cisco IOS dispatcher is defined as `nornir_nautobot.plugins.tasks.dispatcher.cisco_ios.NetmikoCiscoIos`. You also must hand any installation of the packaging and assurance that the value you provide is importable in the environment you run it on.
